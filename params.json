{"tagline":"An easy-to-manipulate object for dealing with URIs in REALbasic","body":"### RB-URI\r\nThis class aims to provide an object which can be manipulated both like a URI object and like a string. To that end _this class converts directly to and from a string_. Additionally, all parsing is done with RB's string manipulation primitives rather than with regular expressions, plugins, or the extended RB runtime (that is, anything that requires the compiler to include an external Libs directory.) This class also aims to be 100% usable by all REALstudio license levels.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"RB-URI"}
